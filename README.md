A **Maritime Content & Recruitment Platform** built with the **MERN stack** — MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js.

This project serves as the foundation for an AI-assisted **recruitment and crew management system** initially focused on the maritime industry, with plans to scale into broader recruitment domains. It empowers shipping companies, crewing agencies, and seafarers with tools to manage jobs, applicant profiles, certification tracking, and crew deployment efficiently.
